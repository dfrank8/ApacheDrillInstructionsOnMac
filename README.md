# ApacheDrillInstructionsOnMac
This is a tutorial I've created that walks a user through the installation and testing of MongoDB and ApacheDrill toolset. Apache Drill is an amazing tool that is used to run relational queries on non-relational databases (such as MongoDB). This tutorial goes all the way up to attaching the database to Tableau, but this feature is currently not supported.
